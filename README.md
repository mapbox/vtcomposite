# Overview 

    npm install @mapbox/vtcomposite

Compositing is a tool to combine multiple vector tiles into a single tile. For a more in depth explanation about how compositing works, see the [tutorial][8]. 

vtcomposite is made possible with node-cpp-skel, vtzero, geometry.hpp, spatial-algorithms, gzip-hpp and boost geometry.

# Installation

Each `make` command is specified in [`Makefile`](./Makefile)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mapbox/vtcomposite.git
cd vtcomposite

# Build binaries. This looks to see if there were changes in the C++ code. This does not reinstall deps.
make

# Run tests
make test

# Cleans your current builds and removes potential cache
make clean

# Cleans everything, including the things you download from the network in order to compile (ex: npm packages).
# This is useful if you want to nuke everything and start from scratch.
# For example, it's super useful for making sure everything works for Travis, production, someone else's machine, etc
make distclean

# This skel uses documentation.js to auto-generate API docs.
# If you'd like to generate docs for your code, you'll need to install documentation.js,
# and then add your subdirectory to the docs command in package.json
npm install -g documentation
npm run docs
```

### Customizing the compiler toolchain

By default we use `clang++` via [mason](https://github.com/mapbox/mason). The reason we do this is:

 - We want to run the latest and greatest compiler version, to catch the most bugs, provide the best developer experience, and trigger the most helpful warnings
 - We use clang-format to format the code and each version of clang-format formats code slightly differently. To avoid friction around this (and ensure all devs format the code the same) we default to using the same version of clang++ via mason.
 - We want to support [LTO](https://github.com/mapbox/cpp/blob/master/glossary.md#link-time-optimization) in the builds, which is difficult to do on linux unless you control the toolchain tightly.

The version of the clang++ binary (and related tools) is controlled by the [`mason-versions.ini`](./mason-versions.ini), and uses `mason-js` uses to install the toolchain.

All that said, it is still absolutely possible and encouraged to compile your module with another compiler toolchain. In fact we hope that modules based on node-cpp-skel do this!

To customize the toolchain you can override the defaults by setting these environment variables: CXX, CC, LINK, AR, NM. For example to use g++-6 you could do:


```bash
export CXX="g++-6"
export CC="gcc-6"
export LINK="g++-6"
export AR="ar"
export NM="nm"
make
```

These environment variables will override the compiler toolchain defaults in `make_global_settings` in the [`binding.gyp`](./binding.gyp).


### Warnings as errors

By default the build errors on compiler warnings. To disable this do:

```
WERROR=false make
```

### Sanitizers

You can run the [sanitizers](https://github.com/mapbox/cpp/blob/master/glossary.md#sanitizers), to catch additional bugs, by doing:

```shell
make sanitize
```

The sanitizers [are part of the compiler](https://github.com/mapbox/cpp/blob/master/glossary.md#sanitizers) and are also run in a specific job on Travis.

# Code coverage

To see code coverage you can view current results online at [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mapbox/vtcomposite/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mapbox/vtcomposite) or you can build in a customized way and display coverage locally like:

```
make coverage
```

**Note**

Use [`// LCOV_EXCL_START` and `// LCOV_EXCL_STOP`](https://github.com/mapbox/vtvalidate/blob/master/src/vtvalidate.cpp#L70-L73) to ignore from [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mapbox/vtcomposite) _remotely_. However, this won't ignore when running coverage _locally_.

For more details about what `make coverage` is doing under the hood see https://github.com/mapbox/cpp#code-coverage.

# Benchmarks

Benchmarks can be run with the bench/bench.js script to test vtcomposite against common real-world fixtures (provided by mvt-fixtures) and to test vtcomposite against its predecessor compositing library node-mapnik. When making changes in a pull request, please provide the benchmarks from the master branch and the HEAD of your current branch.  You can control the `concurrency`, `iterations`, and `package` of the benchmarks with the following command:

    node bench/bench.js --iterations 1000 --concurrency 5 --package vtcomposite

And the output will show how many times the library was able to execute per second, per fixture:

    1: single tile in/out ... 16667 runs/s (3ms)
    2: two different tiles at the same zoom level, zero buffer ... 4167 runs/s (12ms)
    3: two different tiles from different zoom levels (separated by one zoom), zero buffer ... 633 runs/s (79ms)
    4: two different tiles from different zoom levels (separated by more than one zoom), zero buffer ... 1429 runs/s (35ms)
    5: tiles completely made of points, overzooming, no properties ... 3846 runs/s (13ms)

# Viz

The viz/ directory contains a small node application that is helpful for visual QA of vtcomposite results. It requests a single Mapbox street tile at z6 and uses the `composite` function to overzoom the tile at `z7`. In order to request tiles, you'll need a `MapboxAccessToken` environment variable and you'll need to run both a local tile server and a simple server for your `viz` application. 

```shell
cd viz
npm install
MapboxAccessToken={token} node app.js
# localhost:3000

#in a separate terminal tab, run a simple server on a port of your choosing
#navigate to this port in your browser 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer x000
```

# Tutorial
## What is compositing? 

Compositing is a tool to combine multiple vector tiles into a single tile. Compositing allows a user to: 

- **Merge tiles.** Merges 2 or more tiles into a single tile at the same zoom level. 
- **Overzoom tiles.** Displays data at a higher zoom level than that the tileset max zoom. 
- **Clip tiles.** Clips the extraneous portion of a tile that’s been overzoomed. 


## Compositing: Merging 2+ Tiles

Let’s say you have two tiles at `z5` - `santacruz.mvt` & `losangeles.mvt`. Each tile contains a single point that corresponds to one of the two cities. You could generate a single tile, `santa_cruz_plus_la-5-5-12.mvt` that contains both points by compositing the two tiles. 

## Source Tiles

`santacruz.mvt` - single point

## Output Tile

**Composited Tile:** `santa_cruz_plus_la-5-5-12.mvt`


![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_04E22B61D71C1B99F8EBA3C41F5DDF0F28DDD0F66171831E6A32600C9DBCD6E9_1531946439263_scla.png)


**`vtcomposite` code:** 


    const santaCruzBuffer = fs.readFileSync('/santacruz.mvt');
    const losAngelesBuffer = fs.readFileSync('/losangeles.mvt');
    
    const tiles = [
      {buffer: santaCruzBuffer, z:5, x:5, y:12},
      {buffer: losAngelesBuffer, z:5, x:5, y:12}
    ];
    
    const zxy = {z:5, x:5, y:12};
    
    composite(tiles, zxy, {}, (err, vtBuffer) => {
      fs.writeFileSync('/santa_cruz_plus_la-5-5-12.mvt', vtBuffer);
    });


## Compositing: Overzooming & Clipping Tiles
![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_04E22B61D71C1B99F8EBA3C41F5DDF0F28DDD0F66171831E6A32600C9DBCD6E9_1531946439263_scla.png)



Let’s say we want to display our composited tile: `santa_cruz_plus_la-5-5-12.mvt` at `z6`. 

We know that as zoom levels increase, each tile divides into four smaller tiles. We can calculate each the `zxy` of the z6 tiles using the formula outlined below. There are also libraries, such as [*mapbox/tilebelt*](http://github.com/mapbox/tilebelt) that calculate the parent or children tiles for you, as well as other tile math calculations.



If the `zxy` is `5/5/12`, the `z6` children tiles are located at: 

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_04E22B61D71C1B99F8EBA3C41F5DDF0F28DDD0F66171831E6A32600C9DBCD6E9_1532040176336_Screen+Shot+2018-07-19+at+3.42.16+PM.png)


**`vtcomposite` code:** 


    const santaCruzAndLABuffer = fs.readFileSync('/santa_cruz_plus_la-5-5-12.mvt');
    
    const tiles = [
      {buffer: santaCruzAndLABuffer, z:5, x:5, y:12}
    ];
    
    //map request 
    const zxy = {z:6, x:10, y:24};
    
    composite(tiles, zxy, {}, (err, vtBuffer) => {
      fs.writeFileSync('/santa_cruz_plus_la-6-10-24.mvt', vtBuffer);
    });

In this example, the tile being requested is at z6, but our source tile is a z5 tile. In this scenario, we must **overzoom**. 

Each zoom level scales geometries by a power of 2. Thus, you can calculate coordinates at each zoom level knowing the original geometry and the (over)zoom factor. 


      // original geometry = Santa Cruz tile coordinate at 5/5/12
      const originalGeometry = {x:637, y:1865};
      let x = originalGeometry.x;
      let y = originalGeometry.y;
      
      //increasing geometry size by a zoom factor of 1 
      const zoom_factor = 1; 
      
      const scale = Math.pow(2,zoom_factor); //1 << 1 
      
      //scale x and y geometries by the zoom_factor 
      let xScale = x*scale;
      let yScale = y*scale;
      
      //divide the scaled geometries by the tile extent (4096) to see the point moves to another tile 
      let xtileOffset = Math.floor(xScale/4096);
      let ytileOffset = Math.floor(yScale/4096);
      
      //subtract the difference between the x and y tileoffsets. 
      let xOffset = xScale - (xtileOffset * 4096);
      let yOffset = yScale - (ytileOffset * 4096);  
    
      //the xOffset and yOffset will be the x,y point at z6


Based off these equations, we know that resulting `(x,y)` point geometries for Santa Cruz and Los Angeles overzoomed at `z6` are: 


    Santa Cruz point = [1274, 3730] at zxy 6/10/24
    Los Angeles point = [90, 2318] at zxy 6/11/25


## Clipping

Wait a second…! Los Angeles isn’t the tile we requested - `{z:6, x:10, y:24}` - it’s in `{z:6, x:11, y:25}`. 

That means we need to **clip** the overzoomed geometries to only include the point(s) we need for tile  `{z:6, x:10, y:24}`. Since Santa Cruz is the only geometry in `{z:6, x:10, y:24}`, we **clip** extraneous data, which means we remove any geometries that are not included in the `z6` tile, but *are* included in the parent tile that’s been overzoomed - `{z:5, x:5, y:12}`. See ya Los Angeles! 

## Clipping with a `buffer_size` 

In the example above, we clipped geometries based on the default tile boundaries (4096X4096). However, the `composite` function always us to have control over which geometries we include/exclude outside the requested tile when clipping. By passing in a `buffer_size` to the compositing function, we are able to explicitly state if we want to keep geometries outside the tile extent when overzooming.
